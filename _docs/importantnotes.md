* Selecting any of the Hooks in the options page will mean Universal Split Screen will run code in the process of the game. This may be detected as cheating or a virus by a game's anti-cheat or your antivirus. _**Be careful not to use hooks on any games with an anti-cheat system!**_
* After ending split screen with Hooks enabled, it is always best to restart all the game instances. Source games (most Valve games) will start to slow down significantly otherwise.
* You can click Enable window resizing on a window to allow it to be resized (hover your mouse over the window edges). This can cause stretching in some games, however.
* If you have inconsistent mouse movement, especially when moving multiple mice, make sure the polling rates on your mice are setas low as possible. You can usually set this in your mouse configuration program (look on the manufacturer's website). This is especially important if you have 'Send raw mouse input' selected.
