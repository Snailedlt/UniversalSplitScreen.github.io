Minecraft does not support controllers, so you will need multiple keyboards and mice.

## Minecraft setup
To launch two separate Minecraft instances, we will need a launcher called MultiMC
1. Download and extract [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download)

1. Run MultiMC and log in with your Mojang account.

1. Create two(or more) instances by clicking Add Instance. Make sure they have a different names.

1. (Optional) [Install OptiFine with MultiMC](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/wiki/MultiMC-and-OptiFine) for better performance.

1. * (If you have multiple Minecraft accounts) Select the first instance and click Launch. Change account in the top-right corner, then repeat for the second instance.
   * (If you have one Minecraft account) Select the first instance and click Launch Offline. Set your username to anything. Repeat for the second instance

1. Make sure the games are running in windowed mode. Resize them however you like.

1. Start a singleplayer world and open to LAN in the pause menu. The other player can join from the multiplayer menu. Alternatively, you can connect to any server (with multiple Minecraft accounts) or an 'Offline' server (if you have one Minecraft account).

## Split screen setup
1. See how to install the program in the Quick Start guide.

1. In options, select the Minecraft preset and click Load.

1. Go back to the Current window tab.

1. Alt+tab into the first game. Set the mouse and keyboard. Repeat for the second game.

1. Click Start split screen. You should now be able to play. Press End to stop.

## Tips
 * If you have inconsistent mouse movement, especially when moving multiple mice, make sure the polling rates on your mice are set as low as possible. You can usually set this in your mouse configuration program (look on the manufacturer's website).
 
 * If the mouse cursor is flickering, try setting VSync on by dragging the FPS limit slider to the left.
